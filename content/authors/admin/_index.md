I am currently pursuing Masters in Computational Mechanics from the Technical University of Munich, during which I've developed excellent time management and organisational skills due to a series of close-knit coursework deadlines and exams. As a result, I've become incredibly adaptable and able to work under pressure effectively. 

Working on developing an Optimzation framework in collaboration with BMW, has got me passionate about and interested in Software Quality and Testing, Optimzation strategies along with understanding the importance of Machine Learning and it's various techniques and applications.
